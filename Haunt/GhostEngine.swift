    Image 1 is the user's real photo. Image 2 shows a specific ghost. Add that EXACT ghost to Image 1 like a real \
    apparition caught on camera. PLACEMENT: do not center it or make it pose — position it off to one side, in the \
    background, in a doorway, behind furniture, or near the edge of the frame, as if caught unintentionally. \
    VISIBILITY: the ghost must be CLEARLY VISIBLE and solid enough to read instantly as a figure — a ghostly white \
    draped apparition with glowing eyes, only lightly translucent (NOT faint, NOT barely-there). Hidden by where it \
    stands, not by being invisible. Ground it (floor contact, soft shadow, the room's own light) and deepen the \
    shadows around it. Keep the room's layout, furniture and lighting recognizable. Photoreal, deeply unsettling, no text.
